# CS303 - Logic and Digital System Design

This repository was created for the **CS303: Logic and Digital System Design** course offered by the Computer Science and Engineering program at SabancÄ± University.

## Course Description

CS303 covers the fundamental concepts of digital systems and hardware design. The main topics of the course include:

- Boolean algebra and logic gates  
- Combinational circuit design  
- Karnaugh maps and simplification  
- Basic arithmetic circuits (adders, comparators, etc.)  
- Sequential circuits: flip-flops, counters, registers  
- Finite State Machine (FSM) design  
- Modeling digital systems using Verilog HDL  
- Simulation and writing testbenches

## Tools Used

- **Digital* (for simulation)  
- **Quartus Prime** (for synthesis and FPGA programming)  
- **Verilog HDL** (for hardware design)

## Project

As part of the course, students are expected to complete a digital system design project either individually or in teams. This repository may contain Verilog source files, testbenches, and other related materials from the course project.
